# UART CRC32 Applications for TMS570LC4357

This repository contains a series of UART-based CRC32 applications for the **TI LAUNCHXL2-570LC43** development board (TMS570LC4357BZWT).  
The goal is to reliably receive high-speed UART data, detect idle timeouts, and compute a **CRC32 checksum using the Ethernet (IEEE 802.3) polynomial**.

## Project Evolution & Key Learnings

### üìÅ uart-crc32

- **Blocking UART reception** on SCI1 (USB UART).
- CRC calculated after 5000ms idle.
- **Limitation:** At 937500 baud, Tera Term must be set to **1ms character delay** to avoid data loss.
- **Lesson:** High baud rates cause character loss in blocking mode.

---

### üìÅ uart-crc32-interrupt

- **Interrupt-based UART reception** with RTI-based idle timeout.
- **HALCoGen config:**
  - Enable SCI1, set baudrate 937500, 2 stop bits, no parity.
  - Enable SCI RX interrupt (VIM Channel 13).
  - Enable RTI (default config, VIM Channel 2).
- **Buffer size:** 6144 bytes.
- **No character loss at high baud rates** (937500) even with bulk data.
- **Notes:**
  - Use `sciReceive()` for bulk interrupt-driven reception.
  - No PINMUX needed for SCI1.
  - Remove or modify default handlers in `HL_notification.c`.
  - RTI Compare 0 Period can be tuned in HALCoGen for 1ms tick.
- **Lesson:** Interrupt-based UART is robust for high-speed, bulk data.

### üìÅ uart-dma

- **DMA-based UART RX echo** on SCI3 (external USB-TTL via CH340E).
- **HALCoGen does not support DMA for SCI1** on TMS570LC43x, so SCI3 is used.
- **Manual DMA configuration** required.
- **Critical finding:**
  - **DMA will not work unless "Enable Cache" is unchecked** in the R5-MPU-PMU tab in HALCoGen.
  - After disabling cache, DMA works on both new and old boards.
- **Limitation:**
  - **DMA RX echo is only reliable at lower baud rates (e.g., 26042).**
  - At higher baud rates, character loss occurs.
- **Lesson:** DMA and CPU cache can cause data coherency issues; always disable cache for DMA on this device.

### üìÅ uart-crc32-dma

- **Current project:**
  - DMA-based UART RX on SCI3, with CRC32 calculation after 5 seconds of idle.
  - Baud rate set to 26042 for reliable operation.
  - Uses RTI for 1ms tick and idle timeout detection.
  - Welcome message at startup.
  - **DMA is re-armed for every byte, so reception is continuous.**
- **Lesson:** For continuous, reliable DMA UART RX and CRC32, use lower baud rates and disable cache.

## Problems Faced & Solutions

- **Character loss at high baud rates** in blocking mode:
  - Solution: Use interrupt-based UART or DMA (with cache disabled).
- **DMA not working:**
  - Solution: Disable cache in HALCoGen (R5-MPU-PMU tab).
- **DMA not supported for SCI1:**
  - Solution: Use SCI3 with external USB-TTL adapter.
- **DMA RX echo only reliable at low baud rates:**
  - Solution: Set baud rate to 26042 for DMA-based projects.
