# UART CRC32 Applications for TMS570LC4357

This repository contains a series of UART-based CRC32 applications developed for the **TI LAUNCHXL2-570LC43** development board featuring the **TMS570LC4357BZWT** microcontroller. The objective is to reliably receive high-speed UART data, detect idle timeouts, and compute a **CRC32 checksum using the Ethernet (IEEE 802.3) polynomial**.

- **Baud Rate**: 937500
- **UART Config**: 2 Stop Bits, No Parity
- **Max Data Size**: 4096 bytes
- **Idle Timeout**: 5000 ms

## üóÇ Project Structure

### üìÅ uart-crc32

**Objective**: Basic implementation using UART SCI1 (USB) with CRC32 calculation after idle timeout.

**Features**:

- Blocking UART reception.
- Uses HALCoGen configuration.
- CRC calculated after 5000ms idle time.
- Simple implementation, but has **character loss at high baud rates**.

**Limitations**:

- At 937500 baud, Tera Term must be set to **1ms character delay** to avoid data loss.

### üìÅ uart-crc32-interrupt

**Objective**: Improve reliability with interrupt-based UART reception and RTI-based idle timeout detection.

**Key HALCoGen Configurations**:

- **SCI1**: Enabled RX interrupt (VIM Channel 13).
- **RTI**: Enabled with default config for 1ms tick using Compare 0 (VIM Channel 2).
- **Receive Buffer Size**: 6144 bytes.
- `sciReceive()` used to initiate buffered interrupt-driven reception.

**Advantages**:

- No data loss at 937500 baud, even without Tera Term character delay.
- Efficient for moderate use cases.

**Notes**:

- `HL_notification.c` default handlers removed or redirected to user `main.c`.
- RTI compare period tuned to detect 5000ms idle.

### üìÅ uart-crc32-dma (WIP)

**Objective**: Implement UART reception using DMA for robust, non-blocking, high-speed transfer.

**Challenges**:

- **HALCoGen lacks DMA support** for TMS570LC43x SCI modules.
- SCI1 **cannot be used with DMA**, requiring external UART via SCI3/SCI4.
- Used external USB-TTL module (CH340E) for SCI3.
- DMA setup performed manually via `HL_sys_dma.c`.

**Current Status**:

- Interrupt and polling for SCI3 working fine.
- DMA initialization appears correct but **no data is transferred**.
- Suspected hardware or undocumented limitations.
- TI community post for support:
