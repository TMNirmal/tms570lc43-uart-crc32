# UART CRC32 Applications for TMS570LC4357

This repository contains a series of UART-based CRC32 applications developed for the **TI LAUNCHXL2-570LC43** development board featuring the **TMS570LC4357BZWT** microcontroller.  
The goal is to reliably receive high-speed UART data, detect idle timeouts, and compute a **CRC32 checksum using the Ethernet (IEEE 802.3) polynomial**.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Critical Notes for DMA Operation

- **Cache must be disabled for DMA to work reliably.**

  - In HALCoGen, go to the R5-MPU-PMU tab and **uncheck "Enable Cache"**.
  - If cache is enabled, DMA transfers may silently fail or not update RAM as expected.
  - This applies to both new and old boards.

- **DMA UART RX echo is only reliable at lower baud rates (e.g., 26042).**

  - At higher baud rates, character loss or data corruption may occur due to CPU/DMA limitations and cache effects.
  - For high-speed UART (e.g., 937500 baud), use interrupt-based or polling-based UART reception.

- **Interrupt and polling-based UART reception are reliable at high baud rates.**
  - Use these methods for applications requiring maximum UART throughput.

## üóÇ Project Structure

### üìÅ uart-crc32

**Objective:** Basic implementation using UART SCI1 (USB) with CRC32 calculation after idle timeout.

- Blocking UART reception.
- Uses HALCoGen configuration.
- CRC calculated after 5000ms idle time.
- Simple implementation, but has **character loss at high baud rates**.

**Limitations:**  
At 937500 baud, Tera Term must be set to **1ms character delay** to avoid data loss.

---

### üìÅ uart-crc32-interrupt

**Objective:** Improve reliability with interrupt-based UART reception and RTI-based idle timeout detection.

- **SCI1:** Enabled RX interrupt (VIM Channel 13).
- **RTI:** Enabled with default config for 1ms tick using Compare 0 (VIM Channel 2).
- **Receive Buffer Size:** 6144 bytes.
- `sciReceive()` used to initiate buffered interrupt-driven reception.

**Advantages:**  
No data loss at 937500 baud, even without Tera Term character delay.

**Notes:**

- `HL_notification.c` default handlers removed or redirected to user `main.c`.
- RTI compare period tuned to detect 5000ms idle.

### üìÅ uart-crc32-interrupt-largefiles

**Objective:** Enhance interrupt-based implementation to support **incremental CRC32 calculation** for large files.

- Based on `uart-crc32-interrupt`.
- Supports CRC32 computation over continuous large data streams using an **incremental algorithm**.
- Resets and finalizes CRC after **5 seconds of idle timeout**.
- Ideal for real-world scenarios where data exceeds buffer limits.

---

### üìÅ uart-crc32-dma

**Objective:** Implement UART reception using DMA for robust, non-blocking, high-speed transfer.

- **DMA RX echo is now working** after disabling cache in the R5-MPU-PMU tab in HALCoGen.
- SCI3 (external USB-TTL via CH340E) is used for DMA, as SCI1 does not support DMA.
- DMA setup is performed manually via `HL_sys_dma.c`.
- **DMA Parameter RAM** does not need to be explicitly mapped in the linker file for most projects, but best practice is to reserve `.dmaRAM` at `0xFFF80000`.

**Critical Note:**

> **DMA will not work reliably if cache is enabled.**  
> You must uncheck "Enable Cache" in the R5-MPU-PMU tab in HALCoGen.  
> This resolves the "DMA not working" issue on both new and old boards.

**Baud Rate Note:**

> **DMA UART RX echo is only reliable at lower baud rates (e.g., 26042).**  
> For high-speed UART, use interrupt or polling-based reception.
